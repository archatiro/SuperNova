            <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
            <p>Born on a farm in Idaho, us cofounders Bill and John spent our childhoods in the sweltering sun, treating each day as a new opportunity that could be brought out through hard work. After a trip to a local space museum, we gained passion within the world of spaceflight.  </p>

            <h3>A Spark</h3>
            <p>After graduating high school top of our classes, we studied aerospace engineering at Stanford and partnered up with SpaceX and NASA in internships. Just like those farm days, we'd still dream for the stars. After working for NASA for 5 years, we formed SuperNova in pursuit of spaceflight for everyone, not just for the astronauts. We wanted everyone to see and feel the glory and wonder we felt. </p>

            <h3>Us Now</h3>
            <p>Now, as a company worth $1 billion, we've expanded our operations from California to all over the world and to the cosmos, sending about 10,000 people per year on life-changing orbital and suborbital flights. We wish everyone, especially you, to experience the wonder of spaceflight.</p>
